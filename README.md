A C# .NET implementation of [domsson's nuru file format](https://github.com/domsson/nuru).

# Current state

Loads ASCII and Unicode images with 4bpc or 8bpc. Palette not yet implemented.

I realise the need to visualize the output so I am taking a detour to create a viewer which uses the library. This simple viewer is coming together with this repository as an example use case.

# Submodules

This repository uses submodules, so after you clone, use the following commands to get the submodules.

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
